# Entities, Components and Systems

At its heart, Bevy operates using an [Entity-Component-System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) model. Rather than operating in a traditional object-oriented fashion, where your game is composed of individual objects with properties and methods, ECS games work in a fashion that is much closer to a relational database: grouping similar data together in a memory-dense fashion, with the `Entity` serving as a primary key to identify the data, then processing the game data in a batch-wise fashion.

Games in Bevy are largely composed of five core building blocks, that come up again and again:
- **Entity:** [Entities](https://docs.rs/bevy/0.4.0/bevy/ecs/struct.Entity.html) are a simple, unique identifier: signifying which in-game object the data stored in a component belongs to.
- **Components:** [Components](https://docs.rs/bevy/0.4.0/bevy/ecs/trait.Component.html) refer to data that is associated with an entity. You can use any thread-safe Rust type as a component, and they are stored in a performant fashion using [archetypes](internals/archetypes.md).
- **Systems:** [Systems](https://docs.rs/bevy/0.4.0/bevy/ecs/trait.System.html) are largely-ordinary Rust functions that handle the game logic. They access components through [queries](../../book/ecs/queries.html) and can directly read and write resources (including [Commands](communication/commands.md) and [Events](communication/events.md)). When added to your game, they automatically fetch data of the appropriate type, and are run in parallel by the [scheduler](timing/scheduling.md) based on the resources and components that they read and write.
- **Resources:** [Resources](https://docs.rs/bevy/0.4.0/bevy/ecs/trait.Resource.html) are well-behaved global singletons that are used to store cross-system game state that isn't associated with a particular entity. Like with components, you can use any thread-safe Rust type as a Resource. 
- **Assets:** [Assets](https://docs.rs/bevy/0.4.0/bevy/asset/struct.Assets.html) are blocks of data that are used to create content for your game. Game models, raster graphics for your UI, sound effects and so on are all assets.

## Getting Started

To get started, [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), then set up a new Bevy project ("Add Bevy as a Dependency") as described in the [official book](https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/).

The boilerplate needed to make your own app is simple:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    App::build().run();
}
```

If you're looking for some useful functionality out of the box (windowing, graphics, input, a scheduler that automatically loops etc.), you'll want to add [`DefaultPlugins`](https://docs.rs/bevy/0.4.0/bevy/struct.DefaultPlugins.html) as well.

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main() {
	App::build()
        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
		.run();
}
```

By chaining methods together on the [`AppBuilder`](internals/app-builder.md) that we created with `App::build`, we can carefully build up our game's functionality in a modular fashion with the [Builder pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder).

To give you a taste of the syntax for Bevy's ECS, here's a not-quite-minimal Hello World example: 

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::fmt;

// Denizen is a "marker component" here, to allow us to filter for denizens in our queries
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Denizen;

// We use the owned form String, rather than &str in this struct 
// Because resources and components must be thread-safe with a 'static lifetime
#[derive(Hash, PartialEq, Eq, Clone, Debug)]
struct Name(String);

// A custom impl of Display to ensure we can print these names nicely
impl fmt::Display for Name{
	fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "{}", self.0)
    }
}

#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
enum World{
	Venus,
	Earth,
	Mars
}

// Creating a unique timer type for each system that needs one allows us to be sure we're grabbing the right one
struct HelloTimer(Timer);

fn main() {
	App::build()
	// We add the default plugins so our game will loop
	// This also adds the Time resource that we use in `say_hello`
	.add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
	// We're creating a HashMap to record which planet entities a name are on
	.add_resource(HashMap::<Name, World>::new())
	// Startup systems only run once, before normal systems take place
	.add_startup_system(place_denizens.system())
	// When systems cannot be run in parallel, priority is based on insertion order
	.add_startup_system(spawn_denizens.system())
	// The `say_hello` system will be run every frame, but only prints when the timer is complete
	// (See `say_hello` logic)
	.add_resource(HelloTimer(Timer::from_seconds(2.0, true)))
	.add_system(say_hello.system())
	.run();
}

// Because we're modifying the `directory` argument, we need to get the mutable version of it with `ResMut`
// Bevy's ECS finds a Resource with the matching type; we want to be sure we have exactly one resource of each type that we need
fn place_denizens(mut directory: ResMut<HashMap::<Name, World>>){
	// .into() converts our string literal from &str to the required String
	directory.insert(Name("Alice".into()), World::Venus);
	directory.insert(Name("Bevy".into()), World::Earth);
	directory.insert(Name("Cart".into()), World::Mars);
}

// The special `Commands` resource queues up actions that should be performed to modify the World
// We only need to read from the directory resource, so we can call it with `Res` instead
fn spawn_denizens(commands: &mut Commands, directory: Res<HashMap::<Name, World>>){
	// We need to use .clone and .into_iter rather than .iter here 
	// to satisfy the lifetime requirements of .spawn()
	for (name, world) in directory.clone().into_iter(){
		if name == Name("Bevy".into()){
			// .spawn creates new entities with the specified components
			// each tuple entry is a different component
			commands.spawn((name, world));
		} else {
			// Only Alice and Cart are Denizens, so Bevy will be excluded from our query filter in `say_hello`
			commands.spawn((name, world, Denizen));
		}
	}
}

// Queries extract each entity that have all of the components specified in their first type argument
// The second type argument is a query filter, which restricts which entities are actually provided 
fn say_hello(query: Query<(&Name, &World), With<Denizen>>, mut timer: ResMut<HelloTimer>, time: Res<Time>){
	// Only run this system when the timer has elapsed
	if timer.0.tick(time.delta_seconds()).just_finished(){
		// Iterating over and then unpacking the query gives us access to the components for each of its entities
		for (name, world) in query.iter(){
			// Because we're querying for &Query and &World, we need to dereference them before we work with them
			println!("Hello {:?}, my name is {}!", *world, *name);
		}
	}
}
```
